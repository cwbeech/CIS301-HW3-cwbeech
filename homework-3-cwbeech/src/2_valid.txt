Consider these propositional atoms:

p: It is hot
q: I go swimming
r: It is summer
s: I sleep in

//////////////

Part 1:

    Premise: r → s
    Conclusion: s → r

a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.

    Premise: If it is hot, then i sleep in.
    Conclusion: If I sleep in, then it is summer.


b) If the argument is valid, write "valid". If the argument is NOT valid,
    write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.
    (You do not need to complete a full truth table.)

    Not valid, most people sleep in on the weekends year-round. Being hot and
    being summer are not mutually exclusive but still don't perfectly correlate.


//////////////

Part 2:

    Premises: p → q, r → q
    Conclusion: (p ∧ r) → q


a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.
    Premise: If its hot, I go swimming, If its summer, I go swimming.
    Conclusion: If its hot AND it's summer, then I go swimming.







b) If the argument is valid, write "valid". If the argument is NOT valid,
    write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.
    (You do not need to complete a full truth table.)

    not valid. It can be hot without being summer and I will still go swimming, and vise versa.

p: It is hot
q: I go swimming
r: It is summer
s: I sleep in


Part 3:

    Premises: r ∨ s → p, ¬p
    Conclusion: ¬(r ∧ s)


a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.
    Conclusion: It is not summer nor am i sleeping in.
    Premise: If it's summer OR I sleep in, then it is hot. It isn't hot.



b) If the argument is valid, write "valid". If the argument is NOT valid,
    write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.
    (You do not need to complete a full truth table.)

Valid.
